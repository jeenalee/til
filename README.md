## Today I learned...
This is a collection of things I learned each day.

20160321 [Binary Tree in an Array] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Arrays): You can represent a binary tree in a single array. One benefit is that the array naturally represents the tree in a breadth-first order.
20160322 [Fuzz Testing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing): Create a program that will make random test programs that look like other test programs. Run the random test programs. If/when your program crashes, you can find bugs that you couldn't catch before.
